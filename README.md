**Setting Achievable Goals for Optimal Performance**

A company should always set realistic goals to ensure employees can work to their fullest potential. When goals are unattainable, it can demotivate employees, hindering their performance. Similarly, predicting profit for a specific period is like setting a target. If a business knows the potential profit based on its R&D and marketing investments, it can strive to exceed that profit, provided the target is realistic. This article will guide you through the process of profit prediction using machine learning with Python.

**Profit Prediction with Machine Learning**

A company's profit during a certain period is influenced by various factors such as the investment in R&D and marketing. To predict the profit, we need to train a machine learning model using historical data that includes these factors and the profit generated. Predicting profit is crucial for setting achievable business goals. For instance, if a business invests $500 in marketing, it shouldn't expect a profit of $20,000 without other contributing factors. Therefore, businesses must set realistic targets. In this guide, I will demonstrate how to predict profit using machine learning with Python.

**Profit Prediction using Python**

The dataset used for this profit prediction task includes information on R&D expenditure, administrative costs, marketing spend, the state of operation, and historical profits from 50 startups. Let's begin by importing the necessary Python libraries and the dataset to perform profit prediction:
